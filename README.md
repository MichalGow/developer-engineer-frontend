# React JS frontend for classifier 

ReactJS frontend wrapper for Sklearn SVN classifier, which is distinguishing between software development and engineering skills. 

The classifier, written in Python, was taken from [here](https://github.com/SeoGow/developer-engineer-classifier), and it has been converted
into JS using [Sklearn porter](https://github.com/nok/sklearn-porter).

After checkout simply run:

`npm install`<br />
`npm start`
